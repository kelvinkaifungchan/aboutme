                Hi there, I’m Kelvin.<br><br>

                I love to meet people and learn about new ways of seeing the world in the process.<br><br>

                I am particularly interested in process and iteration as a mechanism of resilience to respond to the
                contemporary complexity that surrounds us.<br><br>

                I grew up in Hong Kong but flew out to London to study architecture. During my time there, I
                collaborated with designers and engineers on <a href="./projectindex.html" target="_self">various
                    projects</a> where I developed a specific interest in material ecology and systems thinking.<br><br>

                In winter of 2019, I returned to Hong Kong and joined a small architecture studio focusing on social
                building projects, where I learnt about pitching, designing and managing a construction project.
                <br><br>

                More recently, I have also joined a research project in Hong Kong where I am writing up the research
                framework and data mining for a study in the analysis of adaptability in dense urban conditions.<br><br>

                Currently, I am studying at the Architectural Association in London, and learning to code in
                Hong Kong.<br><br>

                Beyond architecture and coding, I also love to spend my time travelling and hiking.<br><br>

                If any of the above interests you, feel free to send me a message <a href="mailto: kaifungkelvinchan@gmail.com">here</a>, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I
                can.<br><br>

                Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoyed your time here.<br><br>

                Have a nice day!<br><br>
