                Hi there, I’m Kelvin.<br><br>

                I love to meet people and learn about new ways of seeing the world in the process.<br><br>

                I am particularly interested in process and iteration as a mechanism of resilience to respond to the contemporary complexity that surrounds us.<br><br>

                I grew up in Hong Kong but flew out to London to study architecture. During my time there, I collaborated with designers and engineers on various projects where I developed a specific interest in material ecology and systems thinking.<br><br>

                In winter of 2019, I returned to Hong Kong and joined a small <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DOMAT.hk/" target="_blank">architecture studio</a> focusing on social building projects, where I learnt about pitching, designing and managing a construction project. <br><br>

                More recently, I have also joined a research project in Hong Kong where I am writing up the research framework and data mining for a study in the analysis of adaptability in dense urban conditions.<br><br>

                Currently, I am studying at the <a href="https://www.aaschool.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Architectural Association</a> in London, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xccelerateskills/" target="_blank">learning to code</a> in Hong Kong.<br><br>

                Beyond architecture and coding, I also love to spend my time hiking, a hobby everyone seems to have taken up recently. Here are some <span class="link" id= "gallery">photos.</span><br>

                Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoyed your time here.<br><br>

                Have a nice day!<br><br>
